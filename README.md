## üå± Alpha

This project is still in alpha as we transition all of our [reference platform](https://github.com/hyperfy-xyz/hyperfy-ref) code into fully self hostable worlds.
Most features are already here in this repo but still need to be connected up to work with self hosting in mind.
Note that APIs are highly likely to change during this time.

## üê≥ Docker Deployment

The project can be run using Docker. Make sure you have Docker installed on your system.

1. Build the image and run the container:

```bash
docker build -t hyperfydemo . && docker run -d -p 3000:3000 \
  -v "$(pwd)/src:/app/src" \
  -v "$(pwd)/world:/app/world" \
  -v "$(pwd)/.env:/app/.env" \
  -e DOMAIN=demo.hyperfy.host \
  -e PORT=3000 \
  -e ASSETS_DIR=/world/assets \
  -e PUBLIC_WS_URL=https://demo.hyperfy.host/ws \
  -e PUBLIC_API_URL=https://demo.hyperfy.host/api \
  -e PUBLIC_ASSETS_URL=https://demo.hyperfy.host/assets \
  hyperfydemo
```

This command:
- Builds the Docker image tagged as 'hyperfydemo'
- Mounts local src/, world/ directories and .env file into the container
- Exposes port 3000
- Sets up required environment variables
- Runs the container in detached mode (-d)

Note: Adjust the URLs and domain according to your specific setup.
